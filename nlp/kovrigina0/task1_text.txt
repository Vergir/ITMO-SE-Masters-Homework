\section{Introduction}

Using latex is pretty easy if you have a sample document you can follow.

\section{Results}
Including figures, tables, and equations is easy. Latex also permits easy reference to document elements (figures, tables, sections) with the \begin{verbatim}\ref\end{verbatim} command\ref{fig1}. Citations are made with the \begin{verbatim}\cite\end{verbatim} command\cite{lamport}.
